<h1>AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED </h1>

<h1>PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS </h1>

<h1>CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT </h1>

<p>
<b>as of January 14, 1992</b> 
</p><p>
<b>COMPOSITION, APPLICABILITY, AND COMPLIANCE</b> 
</p><p>
The Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants consists of two sections--(1) the
Principles and (2) the Rules. The Principles provide the framework
for the Rules, which govern the performance of professional services
by members. The Council of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants is authorized to designate bodies to promulgate
technical standards under the Rules, and the bylaws require adherence
to those Rules and standards.
</p><p>
The Code of Professional Conduct was adopted by the membership
to provide guidance and rules to all members--those in public
practice, in industry, in government, and in education--in the
performance of their professional responsibilities.
</p><p>
Compliance with the Code of Professional Conduct, as with all
standards in an open society, depends primarily on members' understanding
and voluntary actions, secondarily on reinforcement by peers and
public opinion, and ultimately on disciplinary proceedings, when
necessary, against members who fail to comply with the Rules.
</p><p>
<b>SECTION I - PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT </b>
</p><p>
<b>Preamble </b>
</p><p>
Membership in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
is voluntary. By accepting membership, a certified public accountant
assumes an obligation of self-discipline above and beyond the
requirements of laws and regulations. These Principles of the
Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants express the profession's recognition of its
responsibilities to the public, to clients, and to colleagues.
They guide members in the performance of their professional responsibilities
and express the basic tenets of ethical and professional conduct.
The Principles call for an unswerving commitment to honorable
behavior, even at the sacrifice of personal advantage.
</p><p>
<b>Article I - Responsibilities</b> 
</p><p>
<i>In carrying out their responsibilities as professionals, members
should exercise</i> <i>sensitive professional and moral judgments
in all their activities.</i> 
</p><p>
As professionals, certified public accountants perform an essential
role in society. Consistent with that role, members of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants have responsibilities
to all those who use their professional services. Members also
have a continuing responsibility to cooperate with each other
to improve the art of accounting, maintain the public's confidence,
and carry out the profession's special responsibilities for self-governance.
The collective efforts of all members are required to maintain
and enhance the traditions of the profession.
</p><p>
<b>Article II - The Public Interest</b> 
</p><p>
<i>Members should accept the obligation to act in a way that will
serve the public interest, honor the public trust, and demonstrate
commitment to professionalism. </i>
</p><p>
A distinguishing mark of a profession is acceptance of its responsibility
to the public. The accounting profession's public consists of
clients, credit grantors, governments, employers, investors, the
business and financial community, and others who rely on the objectivity
and integrity of certified public accountants to maintain the
orderly functioning of commerce. This reliance imposes a public
interest responsibility on certified public accountants. The public
interest is defined as the collective well-being of the community
of people and institutions the profession serves.
</p><p>
In discharging their professional responsibilities, members may
encounter conflicting pressures from among each of those groups.
In resolving those conflicts, members should act with integrity,
guided by the precept that when members fulfill their responsibility
to the public, clients' and employers' interests are best served.
</p><p>
Those who rely on certified public accountants expect them to
discharge their responsibilities with integrity, objectivity,
due professional care, and a genuine interest in serving the public.
They are expected to provide quality services, enter into fee
arrangements, and offer a range of services-all in a manner that
demonstrates a level of professionalism consistent with these
Principles of the Code of Professional Conduct.
</p><p>
All who accept membership in the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants commit themselves to honor the public trust.
In return for the faith that the public reposes in them, members
should seek continually to demonstrate their dedication to professional
excellence.
</p><p>
<b>Article III - Integrity</b> 
</p><p>
<i>To maintain and broaden public confidence, members should perform
all professional responsibilities with the highest sense of integrity.</i>

</p><p>
Integrity is an element of character fundamental to professional
recognition. It is the quality from which the public trust derives
and the benchmark against which a member must ultimately test
all decisions.
</p><p>
Integrity requires a member to be, among other things, honest
and candid within the constraints of client confidentiality. Service
and the public trust should not be subordinated to personal gain
and advantage. Integrity can accommodate the inadvertent error
and the honest difference of opinion; it cannot accommodate deceit
or subordination of principle.
</p><p>
Integrity is measured in terms of what is right and just. In the
absence of specific rules, standards, or guidance, or in the face
of conflicting opinions, a member should test decisions and deeds
by asking: "Am I doing what a person of integrity would do?
Have I retained my integrity?" Integrity requires a member
to observe both the form and the spirit of technical and ethical
standards; circumvention of those standards constitutes subordination
of judgment.
</p><p>
Integrity also requires a member to observe the principles of
objectivity and independence and of due care.
</p><p>
<b>Article IV - Objectivity and Independence</b> 
</p><p>
<i>A member should maintain objectivity and be free of conflicts
of interest in discharging professional responsibilities. A member
in public practice should be independent in fact and appearance
when providing auditing and other attestation services.</i> 
</p><p>
Objectivity is a state of mind, a quality that lends value to
a member's services. It is a distinguishing feature of the profession.
The principle of objectivity imposes the obligation to be impartial,
intellectually honest, and free of conflicts of interest. Independence
precludes relationships that may appear to impair a member's objectivity
in rendering attestation services.
</p><p>
Members often serve multiple interests in many different capacities
and must demonstrate their objectivity in varying circumstances.
Members in public practice render attest, tax, and management
advisory services. Other members prepare financial statements
in the employment of others, perform internal auditing services,
and serve in financial and management capacities in industry,
education, and government. They also educate and train those who
aspire to admission into the profession. Regardless of service
or capacity, members should protect the integrity of their work,
maintain objectivity, and avoid any subordination of their judgment.
</p><p>
For a member in public practice, the maintenance of objectivity
and independence requires a continuing assessment of client relationships
and public responsibility. Such a member who provides auditing
and other attestation services should be independent in fact and
appearance. In providing all other services, a member should maintain
objectivity and avoid conflicts of interest.
</p><p>
Although members not in public practice cannot maintain the appearance
of independence, they nevertheless have the responsibility to
maintain objectivity in rendering professional services. Members
employed by others to prepare financial statements or to perform
auditing, tax, or consulting services are charged with the same
responsibility for objectivity as members in public practice and
must be scrupulous in their application of generally accepted
accounting principles and candid in all their dealings with members
in public practice.
</p><p>
<b>Article V - Due Care</b> 
</p><p>
<i>A member should observe the profession's technical and ethical
standards, strive continually to improve competence and the quality
of services, and discharge professional responsibility to the
best of the member's ability.</i> 
</p><p>
The quest for excellence is the essence of due care. Due care
requires a member to discharge professional responsibilities with
competence and diligence. It imposes the obligation to perform
professional services to the best of a member's ability with concern
for the best interest of those for whom the services are performed
and consistent with the profession's responsibility to the public.
</p><p>
Competence is derived from a synthesis of education and experience.
It begins with a mastery of the common body of knowledge required
for designation as a certified public accountant. The maintenance
of competence requires a commitment to learning and professional
improvement that must continue throughout a member's professional
life. It is a member's individual responsibility. In all engagements
and in all responsibilities, each member should undertake to achieve
a level of competence that will assure that the quality of the
member's services meets the high level of professionalism required
by these Principles.
</p><p>
Competence represents the attainment and maintenance of a level
of understanding and knowledge that enables a member to render
services with facility and acumen. It also establishes the limitations
of a member's capabilities by dictating that consultation or referral
may be required when a professional engagement exceeds the personal
competence of a member or a member's firm. Each member is responsible
for assessing his or her own competence-of evaluating whether
education, experience, and judgment are adequate for the responsibility
to be assumed.
</p><p>
Members should be diligent in discharging responsibilities to
clients, employers, and the public. Diligence imposes the responsibility
to render services promptly and carefully, to be thorough, and
to observe applicable technical and ethical standards.
</p><p>
Due care requires a member to plan and supervise adequately any
professional activity for which he or she is responsible.
</p><p>
<b>Article VI - Scope and Nature of Services</b> 
</p><p>
<i>A member in public practice should observe the Principles of
the Code of Professional Conduct in determining the scope and
nature of services to be provided.</i> 
</p><p>
The public interest aspect of certified public accountants' services
requires that such services be consistent with acceptable professional
behavior for certified public accountants. Integrity requires
that service and the public trust not be subordinated to personal
gain and advantage. Objectivity and independence require that
members be free from conflicts of interest in discharging professional
responsibilities. Due care requires that services be provided
with competence and diligence.
</p><p>
Each of these Principles should be considered by members in determining
whether or not to provide specific services in individual circumstances.
In some instances, they may represent an overall constraint on
the nonaudit services that might be offered to a specific client.
No hard-and-fast rules can be developed to help members reach
these judgments, but they must be satisfied that they are meeting
the spirit of the Principles in this regard.
</p><p>
In order to accomplish this, members should
</p><ul>
<li>Practice in firms that have in place internal quality-control
procedures to ensure that services are competently delivered and
adequately supervised.
</li><li>Determine, in their individual judgments, whether the scope
and nature of other services provided to an audit client would
create a conflict of interest in the performance of the audit
function for that client.
</li><li>Assess, in their individual judgments, whether an activity
is consistent with their role as professionals (for example, is
such activity a reasonable extension or variation of existing
services offered by the member or others in the profession?).
</li></ul>

<p>
<b>SECTION II - RULES</b> 
</p><p>
<b>Applicability</b> 
</p><p>
The bylaws of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
require that members adhere to the Rules of the Code of Professional
Conduct. Members must be prepared to justify departures from these
Rules.
</p><p>
<b>Interpretation Addressing the Applicability of the AICPA Code
of Professional Conduct. </b>For purposes of the Applicability
Section of the Code, a "member" is a member or international
associate of the American Institute of CPAs.
</p><ol>
<li>The Rules of Conduct that follow apply to all professional
services performed except (a) where the wording of the rule indicates
otherwise and 1(b) that a member who is practicing outside the
United States will not be subject to discipline for departing
from any of the rules stated herein as long as the member's conduct
is in accord with the rules of the organized accounting profession
in the country in which he or she is practicing. However, where
a member's name is associated with financial statements under
circumstances that would entitle the reader to assume that United
States practices were followed, the member must comply with the
requirements of Rules 202 and 203.
</li><li>A member may be held responsible for compliance with the rules
by all persons associated with him or her in the practice of public
accounting who are either under the member's supervision or are
the member's partners or shareholders in the practice.
</li><li>A member shall not permit others to carry out on his or her
behalf, either with or without compensation, acts, which if carried
out by the member, would place the member in violation of the
rules.
</li></ol>

<b>Practice of Public Accounting</b> 
</p><p>
The practice of public accounting consists of the performance
for a client, by a member or a member's firm, while holding out
as CPA(s), of the professional services of accounting, tax, personal
financial planning, litigation support services, and those professional
services for which standards are promulgated by bodies designated
by Council, such as Statements of Financial Accounting Standards,
Statements on Auditing Standards, Statements on Standards for
Accounting and Review Services, Statements on Standards for Consulting
Services, Statements of Governmental Accounting Standards, Statement
on Standards for Attestation Engagements, and Statement on Standards
for Accountants' Services on Prospective Financial Information.
</p><p>
However, a member or a member's firm, while holding out as CPA(s),
is not considered to be in the practice of public accounting if
the member or the member's firm does not perform, for any client,
any of the professional services described in the preceding paragraph.
</p><p>
<b>Professional Services</b> 
</p><p>
Professional services include all services performed by a member
while holding out as a CPA.
</p><p>
<b>Holding Out</b> 
</p><p>
In general, any action initiated by a member that informs others
of his or her status as a CPA or AICPA-accredited specialist constitutes
holding out as a CPA. This would include, for example, any oral
or written representation to another regarding CPA status, use
of the CPA designation on business cards or letterhead, the display
of a certificate evidencing a member's CPA designation, or listing
as a CPA in local telephone directories.
</p><p>
<b>Rules</b> 
</p><p>
