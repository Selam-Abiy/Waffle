be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics.</p><p>Professionals are capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not received the relevant training.</p><p>Codes of professional ethics are often established by professional organizations to help guide members in performing their job functions according to sound and consistent ethical principles.</p><h2>Objectives of Professional Ethics</h2><p>Professional accountants play an important role in building up the economic well­being of their community and country with their attitude, behavior, and unique services.</p><p>They have common objectives, whether they work in <a href=https://www.iedunote.com/auditor-definition-qualities-types data-wpel-link=internal>capacities of external auditors, internal auditors, financial experts</a>, tax experts, and management accountants.</p><p>Their common objectives are to perform their duties and responsibilities and to attain the highest levels of performance by the ethical requirements generally to meet the public interest and <a href=https://www.iedunote.com/accounting-career-paths data-wpel-link=internal>maintain the reputation of the accounting profession</a>.</p><p>Personal self-interest must not prevail over these duties. The IFAC and ICAEW Codes of Ethics help accountants to meet these obligations by setting out ethical guidance to be followed.</p><div class=x><div class=adsbyvli data-ad-slot=vi_770524074></div><script>(vitag.Init = window.vitag.Init || []).push(function(){viAPItag.display("vi_770524074")})</script></div><p>To achieve these objectives, they have to establish creditability, professionalism, quality of service, and confidence.</p><p>Acting in the public interest involves having regard to the legitimate interests of clients, government, financial institutions, employees, investors, the business and financial community, and others who rely upon the objectivity and integrity of the accounting profession to support the dignity and orderly functioning of commerce.</p><p>In summary, then, the key reason accountants need to have an ethical code is that people rely on them and their expertise. It is important to note that this reliance extends beyond clients to the general community.</p><p>Accountants deal with a range of issues on behalf of clients. They often have access to confidential and sensitive information.</p><p>Auditors claim to give an independent view. It is, therefore, critical that accountants are independent.</p><p>Compliance with a shared set of ethical guidelines gives protection to accountants as well, as they cannot be accused of behaving differently from other accountants.</p><h2>Codes of Professional Ethics</h2><p>Here we will describe the two well-known codes of professional ethics;</p><ul><li>IFAC code of ethics for professional accountants,</li><li>AICPA code of professional conduct.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: center;">IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants</h2><p>A distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act in the public interest.</p><p>In acting in the public interest, a professional accountant should observe and comply with the ethical requirements of this Code.</p><p>A professional accountant is required to comply with the following fundamental principles:</p><p><img loading=lazy class=aligncenter title="IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.iedunote.com/img/22637/ifac-code-of-ethics-for-professional-accountants.png?resize=1280%2C860&#038;quality=100&#038;ssl=1" alt="IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants" width=1280 height=860 data-recalc-dims=1></p><ol><li><h3>Integrity</h3></li></ol><p>A professional accountant should be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.</p><div class=x><div class=adsbyvli data-ad-slot=vi_770524074></div><script>(vitag.Init = window.vitag.Init || []).push(function(){viAPItag.display("vi_770524074")})</script></div><ol start=2><li><h3>Objectivity</h3></li></ol><p>A professional accountant should not allow bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional or business judgments.</p><ol start=3><li><h3>Professional Competence and Due Care</h3></li></ol><p>A professional accountant has a continuing duty to maintain professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure that a client or employer receives competent professional service based on current developments in practice, legislation, and techniques.</p><p>Professional accountants should act diligently and by applicable technical and professional standards when providing professional services.</p><ol start=4><li><h3>Confidentiality</h3></li></ol><p>A professional accountant should respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of professional and business relationships and should not disclose any such information to third parties without proper and specific authority unless there is a legal or professional right or duty to disclose.</p><p>Confidential information acquired as a result of professional and business relationships should not be used for the personal advantage of the professional accountant or third parties.</p><ol start=5><li><h3>Professional Behavior</h3></li></ol><p>A professional accountant should comply with relevant laws and regulations and should avoid any action that discredits the profession.</p><h2>IFAC Code of Ethics &#8211; Threats to Objectivity and Independence</h2><p>The IFAC Code of Ethics works on the basis that an assurance firm&#8217;s integrity, objectivity, and independence are subject to various threats and that the firm must have safeguards in place to counter these threats.</p><p>The threats are as follows:</p><p><img loading=lazy class=aligncenter src="https://i0.wp.com/www.iedunote.com/img/22637/ifac-code-of-ethics-threats-to-objectivity-and-independence.png?resize=1280%2C855&#038;quality=100&#038;ssl=1" alt="IFAC Code of Ethics - Threats to Objectivity and Independence" width=1280 height=855 data-recalc-dims=1></p><ol><li><h3>The Self-interest Threat</h3></li></ol><p>Self-interest threat occurs when a firm, network firm, or a member of the assurance team could benefit from a financial interest in or other self-interest conflicts with an assurance client.</p><ol start=2><li><h3>The Self-review Threat</h3></li></ol><p>Self-review threat which occurs when</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>any product or judgment of a previous assurance engagement or non-assurance engagement needs to be re-evaluated in reaching conclusions on the assurance engagement;

The APB is the Auditing Practices Board in the U.K., which also issues auditing standards (adopted from IFAC, which creates them).</p><p>APB has issued ethical standards with which U.K. auditors must comply when carrying out U.K. audits. They are as follows:</p><ul><li>E.S. 1: Integrity, objectivity, and independence</li><li>E.S. 2: Financial, business, employment, and personal relationships</li><li>E.S. 3: Long association with the audit engagement</li><li>E.S. 4: Fees, remuneration, and evaluation policies, litigation, gifts, and hospitality</li><li>E.S. 5: Non-audit services provided to audit clients</li></ul><p>There is also an E.S. with provisions available for smaller entities, which is not examinable. This offers exemptions and special rules to the auditors of smaller entities.</p><p>These standards were developed about the IFAC Code of Ethics and also the E.C. Recommendation on the independence of statutory audits.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AICPA Code of Professional Conduct</h2><p>The Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants consists of two sections;</p><ol><li>the Principles, and</li><li>the Rules.</li></ol><p>The Principles provide the framework for the Rules, which govern the performance of professional services by members.

The prospective client was not advised of that likelihood.</li><li>Contain any other representations that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to misunderstand or be deceived.</li></ol><h3>Rule 503 &#8211; Commission and Referral Fees</h3><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start=1><li>Prohibited commissions</li></ol><p>A member in public practice shall not for a commission recommend or refer to a client any product or service, or for a commission recommend or refer any product or service to be supplied by a client, or receive a commission, when the member or the member&#8217;s firm also performs for that client:</p><ol><li>an audit or review of a financial statement; or</li><li>a compilation of a financial statement when the member expects, or reasonably might expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the member&#8217;s compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence; or</li><li>an examination of prospective financial information.</li></ol><p>This prohibition applies during the period in which the member is engaged to perform any of the services listed above and the period covered by any historical financial statements involved in such listed services.</p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start=2><li>Disclosure of permitted commissions</li></ol><p>A member in public practice who is not prohibited by this rule from performing services for or receiving a commission and who is paid or expects to be paid a commission shall disclose that fact to any person or entity to whom the member recommends or refers a product or service to which the commission relates.</p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start=3><li>Referral fees</li></ol><p>Any member who accepts a referral fee for recommending or referring any service of a CPA to any person or entity or who pays a referral fee to obtain a client shall- disclose such acceptance or payment to the client.</p><h3>Rule 505 &#8211; Form of Organization and Name</h3><p>A member may practice public accounting only in the form of the organization permitted by law or regulation whose characteristics conform to resolutions of Council.</p><p>A member shall not practice public accounting under a misleading firm name. Names of one or more past owners may be included in the firm name of a successor organization.</p><p>A firm may not designate itself as &#8220;Members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#8221; unless all of its CPA owners are members of the Institute.</p><h3>Comparing the Codes of Ethics: AICPA and IFAC</h3><p>Although auditors must comply with the specific standards adopted in each jurisdiction, familiarity with IFAC&#8217;s International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) in addition to the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct (AICPA Code) is a critical first step.</p><p>When specifications differ, members should comply with the more restrictive of the applicable standards.</p><p><strong>More similar than different</strong></p><p>The IESBA and AICPA codes are more similar than different, although some differences are significant.</p><p>For example, the IESBA Code is divided into three parts;</p><ol><li>Part A applies to all professional accountants.</li><li>Part B, only to persons in public accounting; and</li><li>Part C, to persons in business, in other words, everyone who is not in public practice.</li></ol><p>The AICPA does not apportion its principles and rules in this manner. Other differences are more substantive.</p><p>As for similarities, both codes address areas such as independence, due care, confidentiality, and the truthful reporting of information.</p><p>The principles underlying each code are also similar except that the IESBA addresses confidentiality and marketing as principles (the latter under professional behavior), applicable to all professionals, whereas the AICPA Code includes these as rules applicable to members in public practice.</p><p>IESBA ethics requirements for professional accountants in business, such as corporate accountants, are much like those found in the AICPA Code. However, certain IESBA guidance is more comprehensive (for example, inducements, acting with sufficient expertise).</p><p><strong>Principles vs. rules</strong></p><p>The IESBA Code is often referred to as a principles-based code, while many consider the AICPA Code to be more rules-based. Similar to comparisons made between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, these descriptions can be misleading.</p><p>Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles of the IESBA Code and apply a &#8220;conceptual framework approach&#8221; to determine their compliance with the fundamental principles whenever they know (or should know) that circumstances or relationships may compromise their compliance.</p><p>While the onus is on the professional accountant to do this, the bulk of the IESBA Code describes how the conceptual framework applies in specific situations</p><div
